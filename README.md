Model-free Variable Selection in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space for right-censored data

Abstract. A novel variable selection method is presented for those
sort of regression problems in survival analysis where the response
variable can be right-censored. The proposed approach is model-free,
that is, no model assumption is made between the response and pre-
dictors, and is implemented through a two-stage procedure: firstly, a
previous independence screening is performed to efficiently reduce
dimensionality in high-dimensional data sets; and secondly, from the
remaining variables, the informative predictors are identified as those
showing a gradient function substantially different from zero. Both
stages are formulated in a learning framework based on Reproducing
Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). The effectiveness of this method is
supported experimentally by multiple synthetic data sets and a real
data set from survival in cancer patients, proving that the new method
outperforms classical methods in scenarios with non-linear relation-
ships between variables.
